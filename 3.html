    <h2>Javascript란 무엇인가?</h2>

    <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources" target="_blank" title="javascript specification">
      <strong>JavaScript  often abbreviated as JS<a>, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.</strong> JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
    <img src="JavaScript-Logo.jpg" alt = "" height = "60%" width="60%">
    <p style="margin-top:40px;"> Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.</p>

    <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

    <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>

    <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.
